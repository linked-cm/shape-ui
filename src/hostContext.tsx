/**
 * The host, supplied by context rather than threaded as props.
 *
 * The components that need the host are three levels down — a form renders a field, which
 * renders a value editor, which renders the relation picker — and the picker is the one
 * that needs to search, navigate and offer inline creation. Passing four callbacks through
 * every intermediate component would put host concerns in the signature of components that
 * have no interest in them.
 *
 * So: one provider at the top, `useDataManagerHost()` where it is needed. The default is
 * `nullHost()`, which does nothing rather than throwing — a component rendered without a
 * provider should show an empty picker, not break the page that embedded it.
