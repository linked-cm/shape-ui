/**
 * Reading instances of a shape, through the Linked Query DSL.
 *
 * The counterpart of `write.ts`, and the piece a consumer previously had to write themselves:
 * the components took `instances` as a prop, and the only exported read helper was
 * picker-shaped (label only). So a host got the rendering for free and reimplemented the
 * reading — which is how two ideas of "what a row is" appear in one codebase.
 *
 * Names no project. `SelectBuilder.from(shapeIri)` is routed by `LinkedStorage` exactly as the
 * write is: `AppDataRouter` inside a studio, the app's own default dataset in a standalone or
 * Capacitor build. Read and write route as a pair, or a table ends up looking at a different
 * dataset than the form saves into.
 *
 * The projection comes from `columnsFor`, the same rule the table's columns use, so a row can
 * never carry a property the table does not show or miss one it does.

/**
 * Key each row by the property LABEL, whatever the query returned.
 *
 * The projection asks for `instance[property.label]`, but results come back keyed by the
 * property-shape IRI's local part. For the framework's own IRI scheme —
 * `.../shape/{pkg}/{Shape}/{prop}` — those are the same string, so the mismatch is invisible.
 * For a shape authored in a hash namespace they are not: `…/vocab#Contact/name` has the local
 * part `Contact/name`, and every value lands under a key no caller looks up. The table then
 * renders empty columns with no error, which is the worst way for this to fail.
 *
 * Matching on the last path segment is what makes both schemes agree. Anything already keyed
 * by its label is left alone, so this costs nothing in the common case.
