/**
 * Searching for instances of a shape, through the Linked Query DSL.
 *
 * This is the **default** implementation the host gets for free. Without it,
 * `searchInstances` was an optional host method, so a relation field rendered an empty
 * picker until someone wrote a search by hand — which made "works in a standalone app"
 * true of the table and false of every relation field.
 *
 * It names no project. `SelectBuilder.from(shapeIri)` is routed by `LinkedStorage` exactly
 * like the table read: `AppDataRouter` inside Create Now, the app's own default dataset in
 * a standalone build.
 *
 * The label comes from `labelProperty()` — the same rule the table uses for its label
 * column, so a row and a picker chip cannot disagree about what identifies an instance.
 * Create Now's `Project.searchInstances` RPC computed a label server-side with its own
 * rule; two mechanisms for one question is how the `getShapeInstances` divergence started.
