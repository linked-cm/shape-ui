/**
 * The wire shapes these components speak.
 *
 * Declared here rather than imported from a host application's client package. They were
 * imported from `create-now-js`, and because a `.d.ts` keeps its type imports, the emitted
 * types carried that dependency forward — so anyone installing this package needed one
 * product's client just to typecheck a table. That is precisely the coupling the package
 * exists to avoid, and it survived the move because type-only imports are invisible at
 * runtime and nothing complained.
 *
 * TypeScript is structural, so a host that already has its own version of these — under any
 * name — passes them straight in with no adapter and no cast.
