/**
 * Creating and updating instances, through the Linked Query DSL.
 *
 * The counterpart of `search.ts`, and the last piece of the read/write pair that still
 * went through a control-plane RPC. `Project.createShapeInstance(projectId, …)` needed a
 * project id for three things, none of which require one on the client:
 *
 *   - finding the shape          → the host already resolved the catalog
 *   - minting the new IRI        → `host.dataRoot`, a plain value the host supplies
 *   - recording a projection edit → a Create Now studio concern, not a write concern
 *
 * So the write names no project either, and `LinkedStorage` routes it exactly as it routes
 * the read: `AppDataRouter` inside Create Now, the app's own dataset in a standalone or
 * Capacitor build. That matters beyond tidiness — a read that routes one way and a write
 * that routes another is how a form silently saves into the wrong dataset.
